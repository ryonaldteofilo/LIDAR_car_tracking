# Lidar Car Tracking
Vehicle tracking using 2D point cloud data using with OpenCV and PCL (Point Cloud Library) integrated to ROS (Robot Operating System)  

This ROS project supported my final-year thesis at the University of Bristol, which aims to propose a robust system to track fleets of connected autonomous vehicle for traffic management. Tracking is based on the Kalman Filter algorithm. The [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQBUlW-P2Fw) was carried out using [Raspberry-Pi powered cars](https://www.sunfounder.com/products/raspberrypi-sensor-car) driving around a track with two [2D LIDAR Sensors](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A2/) producing point clouds for processing.
